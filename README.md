Final project for the course Computational Music Creativity.

## Introduction
In this project, I made a pd patch to imitate some sounds in nature, and a control board to manipulate and present these sounds with Mobmuplat.In general, the whole project can be divided into 2 main parts, a pd patch and an OSC file.

### Pd patch
The Pd patch contains 3 parts, sound-generating, sound-playing, and GUI-linking:
